## The Problem

The pandemic has exposed the faulty education system that we currently have. Without face-to-face classes, both teachers and students are having a hard time communicating with each other, thus compromising the quality of education. The most affected are the students and teachers in pre-school to grade school level. Unlike college students, those who are under the basic education level do not have proper venue for learning.
